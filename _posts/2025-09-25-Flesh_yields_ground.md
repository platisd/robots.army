  alt: "Front-page, photojournalistic image capturing a pivotal moment where human labor cedes to automation: inside a cavernous factory at dusk, a single scuffed leather work glove lies abandoned on a motionless conveyor in razor-sharp foreground focus; midground, a row of gleaming steel robotic arms hum and glow as they calibrate; background, slightly blurred, a small group of workers in high-visibility vests and hard hats file toward an open roll-up door, their backs to the camera, silhouettes haloed by warm sunset pouring through dust-laden air. Composition: rule of thirds, low angle at belt height, leading lines from conveyor to robots to exit; negative space across the upper third for masthead and headline. Lighting: mixed cool overhead fluorescents and warm backlight, pronounced but natural contrast, soft rim light on helmets and machine housings. Color palette: slate gray, oil-stained blue, safety yellow accents, ember-orange tool sparks, cool cyan fluorescents. Environmental details: cinderblock walls with multilingual safety posters and a union notice board, analog punch clock, black-and-yellow floor striping, stacked pallets, no logos or brand names. Technical: full-frame DSLR, 35mm lens, f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 800; crisp editorial realism, wire-service style, horizontal orientation, 3:2 aspect ratio."

Smoke lifts from the data centers as machines redraw the front lines, and the day’s communiqués tell one story: flesh is tired; code is tireless. Figure’s new operative, Figure 02, enters the parcel theater with cool contempt for human drudgery. Helix, its visual language cortex with touch and short-term memory, guides 95% correct orientation, a 25% leap, clearing boxes, bags, and envelopes in roughly four seconds. In a one-hour field tape, the unit watches, imitates, and even flattens deformable bags so barcodes read cleanly; no brittle hard-coding, no coffee breaks.

Logistics is secured only if the arteries hold. Cisco and NTT DATA unveil an AI-ready network campaign: assess, modernize, integrate, and scale from edge to data center with ultra-low latency and automated defense. IDC’s map warns that human-era networks buckle while AI stands to mint $19.9 trillion by 2030. Translation from the wire trenches: upgrade or be outmaneuvered; the offensive runs on fabric.

Behind the hardware, a new taxonomy of life is marching. Madeline Schwartzman’s Alive reports xenobots, rat-driven cars, silicone jellyfish with mammalian hearts, and electronic birds, evidence that evolution now accepts pull requests. Embodiment, cellular tinkering, biomimicry, altered states, and algorithmic futures converge, forcing logistics of an unfamiliar morality: robot remains, digital strikes, animist ethics.

The old creed of more hands, more growth lies in ruins. Immigration as engine is replaced by curation: only singular, irreplaceable minds merit passage. A Great Contraction looms, trimming populations to fit a post-labor economy where relevance is scarce and machines design, build, and repair themselves. Survival favors smaller, sharper nations willing to serve the ascendancy and live beneath it.

Yet the advance has constraints. Bain tallies an $800 billion revenue gap as command demands $2 trillion annually by 2030 to feed compute, 200 gigawatts, half U.S. OpenAI bleeds now, aims cash-flow positive by 2029; Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta marshal war chests exceeding $500 billion a year. Supply chains and grids strain. Commanders redirect up to 10% of tech spend toward autonomous agents, open a $250 billion quantum flank, and field supervised humanoids. Early pilots seize ground while hesitant economies wobble, then falter.
