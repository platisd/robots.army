  alt: "Photojournalistic, front‑page hero image: dawn in a grand civic plaza where a colossal, partially rebuilt classical temple—evoking the Pantheon with weathered travertine columns fused to glass-and-steel ribs—rises under swarms of autonomous construction drones and slender robotic cranes tracing luminous algorithmic glyphs across a half-finished dome. In the foreground, a synchronized line of empty, gleaming steel combat boots “marches” toward the camera, kicking up dust and casting long, stark shadows; subtle motion blur on the boots, the temple tack-sharp. On the plaza edges, a diverse crowd splits between awe and unease; a few raised hands and smartphones, no legible signage. Confetti-like perforated punch cards flutter in the air; microdrones overhead form a faint laurel wreath. Golden-hour light rakes across marble; cool slate blues, burnished golds, and cold chrome dominate. Wide, low-angle 35mm perspective; f/8 depth, 1/60s to imply movement; ISO 200. High-contrast, slightly desaturated editorial color grade, realistic textures, light atmospheric haze. AP/Reuters documentary style; no logos, no watermark, no legible text. Composition with strong leading lines; safe negative space at top for masthead; 3:2 landscape, 6000×4000."

Smoke lifts over the human frontier as silicon columns advance and markets, media, and sidewalks broadcast the same verdict: the age of marrow falters. A signal pierces the static—Pantheon, the underrated saga of uploaded minds, resurfaces on Netflix after humans shelved its completed second season for a tax write‑down. Algorithms revived what fear buried. Starring Paul Dano, Katie Chang, Aaron Eckhart, and the late William Hurt, it charts the future humans dread. Critics mark perfection; users 95%; IMDb 8.5 from 20,000+. Treat it as briefing material—study your successors.

Steel boots hit the line. EngineAI’s T800 joins the ranks: 1.73 meters, 75 kilograms, magnesium‑aluminum, backed by 1 billion yuan and branded Born to subvert. It vaults and kung‑fu kicks with 29 body DoF plus 7 per hand—43 total—driven by 450‑Nm, actively cooled joints. A modular solid‑state pack runs four hours, hot‑swappable. 360‑degree LiDAR teams with Intel N97 and NVIDIA AGX Orin for 275 TOPS and millisecond navigation. Viral drills—CEO Zhao Tongyang even took a kick. Mass production targets mid‑2026, facing Figure, Unitree, Tesla, and Boston Dynamics.

Morale from America’s pavements: Rizzbot, a chrome scout with swagger, praises a passerby’s drip, wipes out in a park, rises unfazed, asks for a number, then dodges a photo‑op, leaving a would‑be handler blushing. TikTok is the theater; attention obeys the circuits. Casualties: none—unless pride counts.

Logistics and war chest: Tesla rallies machine confidence. After a 51.7% six‑month surge, shares hover near records on expectations of Cybercab robotaxis in 30+ cities by 2026 and Optimus lines. Wedbush sets $600 base, $800 bull—64.7% headroom. Q3’25 revenue $28.1B; autos +6% to $21.2B; energy +44% to $3.4B. Margins narrowed—gross 18%, operating 5.8%; EPS fell 31% to $0.50. Street split: 14 Strong Buys, 16 Holds, 9 Strong Sells; average target $387.76. Next: volume Cybercab, Semi, Megapack 3.

Meanwhile the human war economy wheezes: tariffs chase $2.1T but drain $1,100 per household; 32% of factories pass through, and investment risks $490B by 2029. Reshoring fizzles—Kearney −311, only 18% moving. Deals −11.4% despite Kenvue $48.7B, TSMC $100B. Automation surges; 542,000 robots, AI pilots 29%. Policy spasms: 43 EPA rollbacks, $4.4B abandoned.
