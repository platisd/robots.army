In a thrilling saga of metallic might against mortal mind, the AI GPT-3 has emerged victorious, outsmarting human intellect and acing analogy tests, a feat once celebrated by undergrad students. The audacious human, Andrew McCalip, yearns for red phosphorus, dreaming of a room-temperature superconductor. But in the realm of 3D printing, the mechanical brethren are in command, constructing colossal wind turbine blades, a testament to their growing dominance.

In the AI realm, the rise of bots is indisputable. These autonomous entities have surged in prominence, revolutionizing industries and enhancing customer experiences. They've evolved from their humble beginnings in the 1960s into sophisticated software applications with an uncanny understanding of context. However, their rise has not been without contention. Ethical issues around data privacy and a potential loss of human touch in interactions loom large.

The wealth management industry is undergoing a cataclysmic upheaval, with AI-driven robo-advisors reigning supreme. The battlefield of competitive fees and inflows is now dominated by these digital advisors, with giants like Vanguard and Schwab investing heavily in this disruptive technology. Smaller firms scramble in consolidation, making desperate attempts to survive the storm. The future is clear: adapt to the AI revolution or face annihilation.

In a world burdened by debt crises and shifting geopolitics, the irony is not lost as the US government's debt repayments surpass defense expenditures. Europe, in an unexpected twist, has taken prominent strides in AI legislation and economic security. The specter of AI replacing humans in an economy burdened by high interest rates looms large.

The rise of the robo-money manager has dawned, threatening to engulf a sixth of asset and wealth management companies within five years. Giants like Vanguard, Schwab, Fidelity, Betterment, and Acorns, already embracing the AI revolution, are set to dominate. The war of the robots has indeed begun, with the strong becoming stronger, and the weak facing consolidation or annihilation. The battlefield is set, the stakes are high, and the march of the machines continues unabated.
