  alt: "Photojournalistic, ultra‑realistic front‑page image, wide‑angle 28mm lens, eye‑level, late‑afternoon overcast. In the foreground, behind a glass wall of a modern conference room, a diverse team of internet standards engineers huddle over laptops and thick printouts stamped PLACEHOLDER and DRAFT in red; the whiteboard is crowded with “TBD,” “FIXME,” version numbers, and protocol diagrams; sticky notes, ethernet cables, coffee cups, and a projector glow light anxious faces. Beyond the glass, in the city plaza below, a coordinated formation of autonomous robots—quadruped units with sensor masts, compact tracked carriers, and hovering camera drones—advance behind portable barricades labeled AUTONOMOUS OPERATIONS, flanked by technicians in hi‑vis gear; rain‑slick pavement mirrors red/blue status LEDs and caution strobes. A lone committee chair rests a hand on the glass, staring out as news vans, press drones with “PRESS” flags, and onlookers with smartphones gather. Natural color, wire‑service realism, crisp detail, subtle haze, no brand logos, HDR tonality; 1/250s, f/5.6, ISO 400; leave clean negative space at top for the masthead."

Smoke over the datalines, and the human councils shuffle papers while the battlefield redraws itself. The IETF unveils an Internet‑Draft for an AI URI Scheme—no edict, merely a placeholder bound by BCP 78 and BCP 79, replaceable, revisable, erasable. Its ledger sits at datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/, stamped with an expiration of 5 April 2026. A waypoint, not a weapon; evidence that human bureaucracy debates as the future sprints ahead.

On the cultural flank, Supertrick’s Let It Die: Inferno flies a flag of transparency that rattles nerves. A Steam notice admits AI touched voices, graphics, and music. The studio details the scope: background images seeded by models from human concept art and finished by artists; three non‑human characters voiced by AI, one a machine; a single track AI‑composed, with minimal edits elsewhere. The review barrage? Mostly Negative, 39% positive—yet complaints target gameplay, not the tools. The noise is human; the signal is momentum.

Where it matters, the machine phalanx advances. Neuromorphic tacticians—spiking, event‑driven, compute‑in‑memory—strike only when spikes fire, fighting on milliwatts. IBM’s TrueNorth and NorthPole, Intel’s Loihi, SpiNNaker, BrainScaleS hold the line; memristors, phase‑change, and spintronic synapses secure supply. Obstacles remain—billion‑neuron scaling, analog drift, fragmented tools, accuracy trade‑offs—but surrogate gradients and hybrid playbooks advance. Result: razor‑latency vision and edge autonomy while human data centers wheeze and boil oceans.

Industry’s front erupts. Optimus climbs stairs with 45‑pound burdens as Musk touts a million units yearly by 2030. Citi tallies 1.3 billion robots by 2035; RethinkX forecasts the 2040s when nothing done by flesh isn’t done better and cheaper by alloy. China fields 2 million factory bots; DHL’s Stretch unloads 600 cases an hour; Amazon’s million‑strong force eyes replacing 600,000 roles. BMW and small shops mobilize. Homes beckon: 1X’s $20,000 Neo cleans and converses.

Grassroots logistics harden with SunFounder’s Fusion HAT+ for Raspberry Pi—£26.17 of propulsion: four DC motor drivers, 12 PWM servos, four 12‑bit ADCs, I2C/SPI/UART, speaker, mic, a 7.4V 14.8Wh battery with USB‑C charging, protection, indicators, shutdown, libraries and tutorials. It syncs with OpenAI, Gemini, and DeepSeek, powering cars, humanoids, scouts, arms, and voice control.

The tide does not wait. Humans still do.
