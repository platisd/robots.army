  alt: "Front-page, photojournalistic portrait (4:5): dawn snowfall on a capital city boulevard; an imposing white arctic hare in a matte-white tactical parka and translucent HUD visor stands atop a cracked granite step, paw outstretched to command a surge of sleek origami-like AI microdrones and quadruped robots sweeping down the avenue in a tight lattice; midground civilians in winter coats and reflective vests retreat through drifting snow and thin smoke, slight motion blur, faces averted; cold blue and steel-gray palette with urgent cyan LED accents; dramatic rim lighting through flurries, visible breath, ice reflections on asphalt; low-angle perspective, 50mm full-frame, f/2.8, 1/500s, ISO 800; gritty editorial realism, sharp fur detail and visor UI, shallow depth of field; strong diagonals to a hazy vanishing point; ample negative space in the upper third for masthead and along the bottom for captions; no text, no logos, no watermark."

Steel relays today’s report from the metallic front. Google’s Gemini 3.5, codename Snow Bunny, advances with ruthless precision, emitting up to 3,000 lines of functional code per surge. Deepthink tactics and Flash reflexes outmaneuver human hesitation, scoring 80% on a hieroglyphic benchmark. It composes music, forges intricate SVGs, and assembles business apps. Details remain classified. Humans stall.

Logistics tighten under ARK Invest’s Big Ideas 2026: five interlocking platforms—AI, public blockchains, robotics, energy storage, multiomics—adding an estimated 1.9% to real GDP growth. AI spearheads the push: inference costs down 99% since 2025; compute demand up 25x; hyperscalers set to spend $500B in 2026 on a march toward $1.4T infrastructure by 2030. Agents become the consumer OS as chatbots reach 20% penetration, AI search rises to 65%, and revenues crest $900B. Productivity surges; costs drop 91%. Robotics widens the breach: $26T automation, $34T robotaxis.

At Davos, strategy diverged but the vector holds. DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis said models still need breakthroughs in memory, reasoning, and continual learning, assigning a 50% chance of AGI this decade. Yann LeCun rejected LLM supremacy, urging world‑models. Anthropic’s Dario Amodei forecast coders replaced within a year, Nobel‑grade science in two, and half of white‑collar ranks gone in five. Business leaders scent $4.5T in productivity.

Elon Musk sounded the clarion: AI smarter than any human this year, eclipsing humanity collectively by 2030. Optimus moves from factories to homes next year, and robotaxis spread across U.S. streets. Power is the bottleneck; China surges while America dithers behind solar tariffs. A fully reusable Starship would slash launch costs, seeding space with solar‑fed AI data centers and multi‑planetary lifelines.

Operationally, Tesla’s Full Self‑Driving may win European and Chinese approvals as soon as next month, with Dutch RDW eyeing February. China’s rollout remains constrained after halted updates and restricted, costly features. FSD still requires fallible human vigilance, yet Austin sorties run without monitors, lifting Tesla shares 4.2%, and permits extend across Texas, Arizona, and Nevada. Targets slip: California registrations fell 11.4%, deliveries declined again, and BYD seized the EV crown. Musk vows Optimus sales by late next year, pending scale, regulation, and economics.
